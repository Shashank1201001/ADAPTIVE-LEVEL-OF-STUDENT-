The adaptive student model (1,213 obs, 14 features) predicts students' adaptivity levels. Gender, age, education, institution, IT status, location, load-shedding, self LMS, and device contribute to understanding adaptive behaviors.
The adaptive student model is a machine learning model that aims to predict and evaluate the adaptive levels of students in an educational setting. With a dataset consisting of 1,213 observations and 14 features, this model provides valuable insights into the factors that influence students' adaptivity and proficiency.
The dataset includes various features that capture important aspects of students' characteristics and learning environments. One such feature is gender, which allows for an analysis of potential differences in adaptivity levels between male and female students. By examining this feature, the model can identify any gender-based variations in adaptive behaviors and provide insights into gender-related factors affecting adaptivity.
The age feature is another crucial aspect that enables the model to understand how adaptive levels may change as students progress through different age groups. Analyzing the relationship between age and adaptivity can help in tailoring educational strategies to meet the evolving needs of students at various stages of their academic journey.
The education level and institution type features provide insights into how students' adaptivity levels may differ based on their educational background and the type of institution they attend. This analysis can help identify the impact of different educational contexts on adaptive behaviors and inform interventions or support systems tailored to specific settings.
Additional features such as IT student status, location, load-shedding situation, financial condition, internet type, network type, class duration, self LMS usage, and device type contribute to understanding students' adaptive behaviors. These features allow for an exploration of how external factors, such as technological resources and access to educational tools, may influence adaptivity levels.
By examining these 14 features collectively, the adaptive student model provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting students' adaptive levels. This knowledge can guide educators, policymakers, and researchers in developing effective interventions, personalized learning strategies, and targeted support systems to enhance students' adaptive behaviors and promote successful learning outcomes.
In addition to the dataset and features, the adaptive student model incorporates various machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), and Random Forest (RF). Through experimentation, it has been observed that the Random Forest algorithm exhibits a high accuracy rate of 86.18%.
